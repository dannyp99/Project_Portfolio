Programming_Languages

	- For my favorite class I have taken we had to projects that we had to do.
	- as7 is an assembler that will run 'assembly' instructions. the following files with a bizarre extension are text files containing such assembly
	- as8 is a compiler/interpretor for a language used in the class. The program will execute code in interpretive mode and compile to 'assembly' which
	  can be run by the assembler as7. The compiler supports up to if else while the interpreter accepts lambda expressions

	compile the fsharp as7:
		fsharpc asembler.fs -r am7b19.dll 
		mono asembler.exe  < compif.7b 

	as8:
		fsharpc compilier.fs -r compilatorbase.dll
		mono compilier.exe compile - will compile code entered
