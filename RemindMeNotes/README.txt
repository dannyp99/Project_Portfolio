Final Project Application I created as for my Mobile Development course. 
This app was approved by the professor and the concept of the application 
is chosen entirely by the student.
I found the notes app simple and useful however, I find that while taking
notes I want to set a reminder whether it be something I just remembered
or something related to the notes like professor mentioning test next Monday
I can immediately set a reminder without having to switch apps.

You must create a note to generate a reminder. if you swipe the note in the 
list to the left it will be deleted and swiping right will allow a reminder
to be created.
